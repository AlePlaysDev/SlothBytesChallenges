You have received an encrypted message from space. Your task is to decrypt the message with the following simple rules:

- Message string will consist of capital letters, numbers, and brackets only.
- When there's a block of code inside the brackets, such as [10AB], it means you need to repeat the letters AB for 10 times.
- Message can be embedded in multiple layers of blocks.
- Final decrypted message will only consist of capital letters.

spaceMessage("ABCD")
output = "ABCD"

spaceMessage("AB[3CD]")
output = "ABCDCDCD"

 "AB" = "AB"
"[3CD]" = "CDCDCD"
Combine both = "ABCDCDCD"

spaceMessage("IF[2E]LG[5O]D")
output = "IFEELGOOOOOD"
