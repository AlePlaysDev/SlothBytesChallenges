## Sticky Keys Typing

Someone is typing on the sticky keyboard. Occasionally a key gets stuck and more than intended number of characters of a particular letter is being added into the string. The function input contains original and typed strings.

Determine if the typed string has been made from the original. Return true if it is and false if the typed string cannot have been made from the original.

### Examples

function: isLongPressed(original, typed)
isLongPressed("alex", "aaleex")
output = true

isLongPressed("saeed", "ssaaedd")
original contains 2 E's, but the typed only has 1. Not a sticky key issue.
output = false

isLongPressed("leelee", "lleeelee") 
output = true

isLongPressed("Tokyo", "TTokkyoh") 
An h was typed, not a sticky key problem, just skill issues.
output = false

isLongPressed("laiden", "laiden") 
output = true
